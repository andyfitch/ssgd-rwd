			<h1>RWD - Stack Similarities, Group Differences</h1>
			<p>In the grand scheme of things, responsive web design (RWD) is still in its infancy, and there are a number of different theories on how to use our HTML &amp; CSS toolkit to best adapt to the plethora of devices ready to (attempt to) render your website how you'd like it to render.</p>
			<p>A new solution is to give attributes common to all devices their own descriptive, stacked classes. Conversely, device-specific attributes are given one of two classes; one for dimensions (prefixed with d- for dimensions), and one for appearance and behaviour (prefixed with a- for appearance). The attributes within these classes are overridden using media queries.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Any attributes that remain identical across all devices are given their own helper class.
					<ul>
						<li>These classes are designed for rapid development.</li>
						<li>Stacked together these classes will generate a 'common-denominator' element, which will look identical across all devices.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Any property which varies across multiple devices should be overridden using media queries.
					<ul>
						<li>Avoids the need for describing different devices within the class list itself, leaves the differentiation and breakpoint descriptions to the media queries.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Class names are formatted using the <a href="http://bem.info/" target="_blank">block__element--modifier (BEM)</a> methodology
					<ul>
						<li>Less confusing than previous methodologies</li>
						<li>A more explicit representation of what defines a class</li>
						<li>Promotes OOCSS</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					This solution is built on the <a href="http://inuitcss.com/" target="_blank">inuit.css</a> framework by <a href="http://csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts at CSS Wizardry</a>, which is packaged up with hundreds of descriptive helper classes, ready to stack on to your elements. It also uses BEM, which is nice! :)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Example:</h2>
			<code>
				<pre class="text--silver">&lt;div class="<i class="text--belize-hole">grid__item soft soft-none--top</i> <i class="text--carrot">a-grid__item--home</i> <i class="text--nephritis">d-one-two-three</i>"&gt;
	&lt;div class="<i class="text--belize-hole">soft bg-turquoise border-green-sea height-100p</i>"&gt;
		Box A
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
			</code>
			<p>The example above is the code used to generate Box A below. If you resize your browser or change device you'll notice:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The the classes highlighted in <i class="text--belize-hole">blue</i> describe the similarities between all devices and therefore don't change anything</li>
				<li>The the classes highlighted in <i class="text--carrot">orange</i> describe differences, are prefixed with a-, and change the appearance (in this case just the font size)</li>
				<li>The the classes highlighted in <i class="text--nephritis">green</i> describe differences, are prefixed with d-, and change the dimensions (in this case just the width)</li>
			</ul>
