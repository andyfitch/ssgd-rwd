			<h1>A solution for responsive web design - SSGD (Stack Similarities, Group Differences)</h1>
			<p>In the grand scheme of things, responsive web design (RWD) is still in its infancy, and there are a number of different theories on how to use our HTML &amp; CSS toolkit to best adapt to the plethora of devices ready to (attempt to) render your website how you'd like it to render.</p>
			<p>A new solution is to give device-agnostic attributes descriptive, stacked classes. Conversely, device-specific attributes exist within two classes; one for dimensions (prefixed with d- for dimensions), and one for appearance and behaviour (prefixed with a- for appearance). The attributes within these classes are overridden using media queries.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Any attributes identical constant across all devices are given their own helper class.
					<ul>
						<li>These classes are designed for rapid development.</li>
						<li>Stacked together these classes will generate a 'common-denominator' element, which will look identical across all devices.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Any property which varies across multiple devices should be overridden using media queries.
					<ul>
						<li>Avoids the need for describing different devices within the class list itself, leaves the differentiation and breakpoint descriptions to the media queries.</li>
						<li>Attributes </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Class names are formatted using the <a href="http://bem.info/" target="_blank">block__element--modifier (BEM)</a> methodology
					<ul>
						<li>Less confusing than previous methodologies</li>
						<li>A more explicit representation of what defines a class</li>
						<li>Promotes OOCSS</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					This solution is built on the <a href="http://inuitcss.com/" target="_blank">inuit.css</a> framework, which is ideal for stacking descriptive classes using BEM.
				</li>
